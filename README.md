This master branch contains the source code in a project structure generated by create-react-app.

## Getting Started
A built version of this app is available at jasonkeung.me/feedback-form-frontend

## Description
This is a simple feedback form built with Bootstrap and React.js. To submit, the name fields must be non-empty, the email field must contain a string in the form of an email address, and the message text area must have between 0 and 500 characters.

The message text area features a character counter, which is implemented as a controlled function component. Submission involves submitting a POST request using axios to a hard-coded url. The response, success or fail, is outputted to the console.
